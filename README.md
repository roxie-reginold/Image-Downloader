# Image-Downloader
(Orignal idea from Udemy course: 30 Great Python Projects To Help You Master It In 2023 -> Image Downloader)

This Python script downloads images to a specific folder ("images") using an image url, with the name of your choice.

I have altered the Python script to download the image directly to the "Downloads" directory on your machine (code located in the downloads branch).
